<h1>StatVillage</h1>
StatVillage is a hypothetical village in Canada. Homes in StatVillage
are laid out in a system of blocks on a rectangular grid with 8 homes
per block. In the middle of each group of 8 homes is a playing area.
Houses are addressed using a <a href=hownumbered.html>block and
unit-within-block system</a>. Services (e.g., food stores, shops) are
located on the periphery of the village and are not shown on the map.

<p>Households can be selected for a survey by using a clickable map. There are three versions of the
village:
<ul>
<li><a href=http:select.maxi.html>Maximal village - 128 blocks</a>
<li><a href=http:select.mini.html>Mini village - 60 blocks</a>
<li><a href=http:select.micro.html>Micro village - 36 blocks</a>
</ul>
Some users have reported problems loading the larger village; the smaller 
villages may be useful. Refer to the <a href=hardsoftware.html>hardware and software requirements</a>.

<p>Results from a survey are returned to your web browser and then can be saved to a file for later processing. A <a href=sasdatastep.html>SAS data step</a> is available to read the returned data records.

<p>Many different variables are measured on each household (refer to the <a href=codebook.html>codebook</a>). As in most cities, certain areas of the city are more affluent than other areas.
In this village, higher income earners seem to be concentrated in the top part of the village,
while lower income earners seems to be concentrated in the lower part of
the village.



<p>The data returned for each household are real data taken from <a href=howcollect.html>public-use micro-data files</a> from the 1991 census of Canada. A <a href=codebook.html>codebook</a> is available explaining the various variables and the codes used.
