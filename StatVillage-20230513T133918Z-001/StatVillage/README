This zip file contains the files needed to install StatVillage on your
machine.

There are two sets of files that must be installed in two different
areas of your WWW server.


Set 1:  HTML files describing the village and the clickable maps
 

README             - this file
article            - subdirectory containing the article from 
                     the Journal of Statistics Education and 
                     Figures 1, 2, and 3
codebook.html      - codebook
hardsoftware.html  - hardware and software requirements
howcollect.html    - how the data were collected
hownumbered.html   - how the blocks are numbered
index.html         - introductory screen for StatVillage 
sasdatastep.html   - SAS DATA step that reads the returned data file
select.maxi.html
select.mini.html
select.micro.html  - three clickable maps


Additional files are provided which are not referenced by the WWW pages
but are useful.

gener.select.sas   - SAS program to generate select.maxi.html or
                                             select.mini.html or
                                             select.micro.html
reviewfields.sas   - SAS program to compute summary statistics for the data
reviewfields.txt   - summary of the data values for all dwellings 
                     (the result of running reviewfields.sas on 
                     StatVillage.raw)


These files should be installed in a StatVillage directory in your WWW
area.  BE SURE THAT THE PERMISSION BITS are set to allow read access to
these files over the WWW.

You must modify the 
   <Form method=POST action="/cgi-bin/stats/selectunits.pl">
line in the select.*.html files to point to the proper cgi-bin files below.


Set 2:  Data and PERL Script

 
StatVillage.raw    - raw data for StatVillage
selectunits.pl     - PERL script to take results from the form in 
                     select.*.html and return the information to the 
                     student.


These files must be installed in the /cgi-bin directory of the WWW
server in a /stats sub-directory. If you are installing these files in
a different directory, you will need to modify the select.*.html files
in Set 1 (see above).

BE SURE THAT THE PERMISSION BITS are set to allow both read and execute
permission for the selectunit.pl file. 

The selectunits.pl script makes reference to 
   <a href=//www.stat.ncsu.edu/info/jse/v5n2/schwarz.supp/codebook.html>
and
   <a href=//www.stat.ncsu.edu/info/jse/v5n2/schwarz.supp/sasdatastep.html>.
These must be modified to point to the directory where the StatVillage
files in Set 1 have been stored.
